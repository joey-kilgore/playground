## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Generating 3d Plots
All info is from [HERE](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/impressive-package-for-3d-and-4d-graph-r-software-and-data-visualization) and descibes everything. First install and load the plot3D package.
```{r setupLibrary}
#install.packages("plot3D")
library("plot3D")
```
Now we should load in our data, for this example we will use some basic dummy data.
```{r setData}
t <- seq(0,50, by=.05)
x <- t*cos(t)
y <- t*sin(t)
z <- x*y
```
### Boring 2D plots
These are relatively simple 
```{r make2DPlot}
plot(x,y)
plot(x,z)
plot(y,z)
```

## Exciting 3D plots
The fun stuff
```{r make3DPlot}
scatter3D(x, y, z, clab = c("Z"))
```

Chaning View (use theta and phi)
```{r changeView}
scatter3D(x, y, z, theta = 15, phi = 20)
```

Adding ticks and labels (bty is box type, ticktype is tick style, pch is point style, cex is size of point)
```{r addingTicks}
 scatter3D(x, y, z, phi = 0, bty = "g",
        pch = 20, cex = .5, ticktype = "detailed")
```
